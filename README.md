# TreeExplorer
QT Binary Trees editor with algorithms viewer
---------------------------------------------

TreeExplorer is a simple application developed in C ++ and QT5 that allows you to quickly create binary trees and graphically view the behavior of the main algorithms.

Note: Only binary trees are supported

The available algorithms are:
<ul>
<li>Height of the tree</li>
<li>DFS</li>
<li>BSF</li>
<li>Main algorithms on binary search trees.</li>
<ul>

Other functionalities:
<ul>
<li>Ability to save the tree from the editor in a reusable text file.</li>
<li>Ability to export resized image in PNG, JPG, BMP format</li>
<ul>
